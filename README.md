# Bikesharing

Would a bikesharing program in Des Moines be successful?

## Things to Consider

1. What public transport is already available and is it affordable?
2. What proportion of the population already owns a car?
3. How well have bikesharing businesses performed in other cities?


## Project Goals

This project tackles the last question. We use bikeshare data from citiBike to answer the following questions: 

  1. How Many Trips Were Recorded During the Month of August? 
     Since whether August is perfect for biking, this is an appropriate month to look at the business' success. If it cannot do well during optimal biking whether, can we expect bikesharing to do well Des Moines? 
  2. What Is the Proportion of Short-Term Customers to Annual Subscribers?
  3. What Are Peak Riding Hours in the Month of August?
  4. What Are the Top Bike Stations in the City for Starting a Journey?
  5. What Are the Top Bike Stations for Ending a Journey?
  6. What Is the Gender Breakdown of Active Riders?
