# Bikesharing

Would a bikesharing business in Des Moines be successful?

## Overview of the analysis:

The goal of this analysis is to determine whenther a bike share business would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. There are many things to consider before investing in a bikeshare business. For example, what public transport is already available and is it affordable? We have chosen to look at the performance of a bike sharing business in another city: Citi Bikes, located in New York City. 

Citi Bike user data is freely available on their website. The dataset includes information on the rider (ie. date of birth and gender), as well as the ride itself (ride length, and start and stop locations) for every month since 2013. 

To aid in understand the potential success of a bike share business in Des Moines, we aim to answer the following questions about Citi Bike:

1. Where in NYC are bikes being used most?
    a. Where are bike ride start locations?
    b. Where are bike ride stop locations?
2. How long are bikes checked out for and is there a difference in use between genders?
3. When are bikes being used most frequently adn is there a difference in use between genders?
4. Is user type (subscriber versus customer) changing with gender and time of day?
